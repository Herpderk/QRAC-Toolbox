# Quadrotor Robust Adaptive Control Toolbox
This is a repository undergoing development for use in my research in robust and adaptive control methods. Specifically, I will be implementing adaptive control barrier function, robust adaptive tube MPC, and L1 adaptive control for quadrotor trajectory tracking and delivery. The package also includes convenient lightweight simulation tools, and I have future plans to incorporate ROS functionalities as well.
