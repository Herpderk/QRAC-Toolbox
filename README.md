# Robust Adaptive Control Toolbox
This is a repository undergoing development for use in my research in robust and adaptive control methods. Specifically, I will be implementing adaptive control barrier function, robust adaptive tube MPC, and L1 adaptive control. I will also include convenient lightweight simulation tools, with plans to incorporate ROS functionalities into the package.
